# Plans for Next Week
- We want to start adding in a lot more backgrounds that we can change between with collision
    - This is where classes will start to come into play since we are going to have a ton of load zones and collision areas
- Hoping to be done with all of out artwork either next week or the week after so Dean can help a bit more with front end developing
- We will start work on developing the actual pokemort part of the game and the whole "catching" aspect
- Character interactions will also be added using collisions

1. Default Pokemon intro with a Professor Mortensen talks to you, talks to you about where you live (Avenida Town is a crossroad of many communities. Avenida Town supports itself with numerous alcachofa crops). Your family works in farming, but you aspire become more. You aspire to become the very best Pokemort Trainer there ever was. 

2. You are then assigned the name Shane Lopez and are sent off to the world, starting off in your room.

3. You're then introduced to Avenida Town and are told by your mom to go Professor Mortensen's (your neighbor) house to receive Pokemort. 

4. Professor Mortensen asks you to meet up at his branch office in Academy Town. He has some things to give you there. He reminds you that now that you have a Pokemort, you can now travel safely through routes and the wilderness, because tall grass is dangerous.

5. After your first journey on your own through Route 1, you arrive in Academy Town. Academy Town is introduced as a small town where the Academy founder grew up. He was dissatisfied with his education as a child coming from a quiet and small town, and decided to start his own school to provide a proper education to Pokemort Trainers all over the world. 

6. Player enters Professor Mortensen's branch office, and he gives you a letter of acceptance, textbooks, and school supplies. He tells you that he has a surprise for you at his laboratory at the academy, so you should meet him there again. 

7. Professor Mortensen sends you on your way to the Pokemort Academy. You can then go through Route 2 to go to the Pokemort Academy. 

8. When you arrive at Professor Mortensen's lab he goes outside with you and gives you a tour of the school. If we're not animating this we're just gonna make him give you the dorm key and send you to your dorm.
